Unit Testing Exercise
=====================

You will find the classes Util and UtilTest.

Util contains a number of static utility functions. Some may not be working correctly or could
use improvements.

Make all tests in UtilTest pass and increase the test coverage of the Util module.

You may not have time to test every property of the methods.
